# ðŸ’” Predicting Non-Matches in Speed Dating with Machine Learning

## Overview
Everyoneâ€™s been on a bad date â€” the kind where you know itâ€™s not going anywhere. This project uses machine learning to predict when **two people are unlikely to go on a second date**, based on real speed dating data.

## Why This Matters
Instead of matching for compatibility, weâ€™re flipping the problem â€” we want to know when people **wonâ€™t** click. This insight is useful for dating platforms, social experiments, or just anyone curious about human behavior.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Speed Dating Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment)
- **Size:** 8,293 rows
- **Target:** `match` (1 = mutual interest, 0 = no match)
- **Class imbalance:** ~84% class 0 (non-match), 16% class 1 (match)

## Objective
Our primary goal was to **maximize recall on class 0** (non-matches). Missing a possible match is okay â€” but **incorrectly assuming someone will match when they wonâ€™t** is what we want to avoid.

## Best Model: ðŸ”¥ Logistic Regression (Tuned)
| Metric     | Class 0 Value |
|------------|----------------|
| **Recall** | **89%**        |
| **Precision** | 91%        |
| **F1 Score** | 90%         |
| **ROC AUC** | 0.821        |
| **Accuracy** | 84%         |

> Class 0 (non-matches) was correctly captured 89% of the time â€” making this model extremely effective at filtering out poor matches.

## Top Features (by Importance & Significance)
- `like`
- `funny_o`
- `shared_interests_o`
- `attractive_partner`
- `guess_prob_liked`

These were selected using **Cohenâ€™s d**, **p-values**, and Random Forest feature importance.
